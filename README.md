# :wave: Hi there, I'm Gil

I am a `Data Aficionado` and a `Math Enthusiast`

Right now I'm working @ Globo, as a `Data Scientist` where I extract bussiness insights to optmize process, product and more through beautiful `Data Visualization` and `Dashboards`.

I am currently pursuing my bachelor of Applied Mathematics with Emphasis on Scientific Computing at [UFRJ](http://www.ufrj.br).<br> <br>

My main focus of studies are the fields of computation, algorithms, statistics, optimization and of course, artificial neural networks and machine learning<br>
I am interested in everything that connects Maths and Coding, but mostly on Machine Learning.<br>
My undergraduate research concentrates on the field of Neural Networks and Hybrid Models, connecting Neural Networks to Differential Equations.<br>

## Professional History

- Full time Product Data Scientist at Globo. 12/2021 to now
- Full time Data Analyst at StormGroup outsourced to Globo. 07/2021 to 11/2021
- I worked as a Full Stack (React & Django) and Data Analyst Intern at Voltalia. 03/2021 to 07/2021

## Academic History
Throughout my undergrad studies I've always been close to scientific research, topics I have most connection are:
- Scientific Computing (algorithms)
- Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Regression and Classification models
- Fundamental theory of Neural Networks/Deep Learning
- I also enjoy studying some pure maths such as Analysis, Theory of Linear Algebra, etc.
